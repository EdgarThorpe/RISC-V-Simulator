The project is divided into three phases:

## Phase 1:
- Implemented single cycle design with various instructions of RISC V

## Phase 2:
- Implemented five-stage pipeline with stages IF, DE, EX, MA, WB.
- Implemented data forwarding and data stalling to remove hazards
- Implemented branch prediction to reduce stalls

## Phase 3:
- Implemented cache memory
- Implemented various cache replacement policies such as FIFO, LRU, LFU and Random
